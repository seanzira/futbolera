          Growing up as a foreign citizen in South Africa, football always
          served as an equal playing field for me, cause for a moment, who you
          are and where you're from doesn't matter, all that's important is your
          talent and decisions on the pitch.

        <p class="descriptive-content">
          Writing this article symbolised alot more to me than just a
          surface-level breakdown into the world of football, but then again,
          it's the first of many to come, so stay tuned!
