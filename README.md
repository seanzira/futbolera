# Task 20: Capstone Project - Javascript Fundamentals
## Description 
I've created a football website which focuses on Zinedine Zidane's career and accolades. The intended target market is anybody with an interest in football, and what this webpage does, is inform the viewer about Zidane and what he accomplished in the Galacticos Era.

## How to access the project

There are two ways in which you (and anybody you would like to inform) can access this website. The first thing you can do is install gitHub and follow my account. Once that is done, I will grant you access to this project upon request. The second thing you can do is click on the link - https://github.com/seanzira/capstoneProject to view the contents of this task.

## Usage

In order to use this website correctly, you can scroll to the bottom to view all the contents of the site, and to access the other pages within the website, there is a menu on the first page of the website (as well as 2 icons on the top right hand side of the page which serve the same function) , which when hovered over will give you 3 options (pages), to select from, which are:

1. About
2. Webpage Sources
3. Save for later

### 1. About 

This webpage focuses on the author of the webpage (Sean Zira). This is shown by the brief summary as well the photo of the author next to the summary. This page also contains a "hide/show" button, which when clicked toggles the visibility of the summary. There is also a "save for later" button which you will see throughout the webpage. This button allows you to store the information above the button for you to view later on the "save for later" page. There is also a "like" button which when clicked increments the number next to it, once, to indicate that it has been liked, but when clicked again, will revert back to 0, indicating that the content above it has been unliked. The last thing to take note of on this page is the menu button located on the top righthand side of the page. This is similar to the one you would've noticed on the landing page.

### 2. Webpage Sources

This page contains the sources used to create the content written within this webpage. Below the sources, you will find a "start animation" button which fades out and fades in the "here" hyperlink. Next to that button, you'll find a like button and on the top righthand side of the page, you'll find a menu.

### 3. Save for later

This page contains two headings next to each other. On the left hand side, you'll find a "Saved Information" heading where all the saved text will be displayed, and on the right hand side, you'll find a "Saved Images" heading, where all the saved images will be displayed. You will also find the menu on the top right hand side of the page.

Lastly, to return to the landing page, you have to click the menu.
